# Resume-Analysis-and-Job-Recommendation
This project aims to develop a job recommendation system that uses the skills extracted from a candidate's resume to suggest suitable job opportunities. It employs web scraping techniques to gather job descriptions and compares them with the candidate's skills using Cosine Similarity. The top 15 matching job opportunities are displayed to the user!
